When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository lets me share my work with other contributors, and allows a more stable mthod of managing various types of code on cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The changes on github may not reflect changes you want on your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks work exactly like clones, but within Github. They allow one to create a copy of a repository, but on Github servers itself. Branches operate on new linearities within a repository.
